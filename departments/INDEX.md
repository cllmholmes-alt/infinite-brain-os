# Departments: The Department Map

One row per department folder with its current disposition, so a reader can tell at a glance
which lanes are live. This is a navigation surface, not the source of truth for any one
department's membership; each department's INDEX.md owns its own assembly.

| Department | Disposition | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `_template/` | template | the assembly pattern every department starts from |
| `example-studio-ops/` | example | the worked example department for the starter walkthrough |
| `devops-platform/` | live | shared cross-cutting platform department: CI/CD, secrets, deployment, environments, observability |
| `adhd-os-product/` | live | ships the ADHD-OS brand: master reference database, alternative design, websites, and the Expo dashboard app |
| `agentic-systems/` | live | governs approval-gated, evidence-first agent execution under the TALOS brand; consumes devops-platform and rtk |

Assemble a new department by copying `_template/`, following `departments/README.md` and
`_system/department-assembly-rules.md`, then add a row here with disposition `live`.
