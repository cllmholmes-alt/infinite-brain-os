## Read this first

The Infinite Brain is not only a clean knowledge graph. Its intended business purpose is to
let companies build AI-first shadow departments with a thin layer of humans on top. The
department is the real unit of ROI. A smarter person with a better toolbar is not enough.

## 1. True AI ROI comes from whole-function redesign, not isolated tool gains

Individual productivity gains are real, but they do not automatically become company ROI.
The history pattern is the same as the computer-in-the-corner era: one step improves, but
the whole workflow still bottlenecks in old approvals, inboxes, meetings, and handoffs.

The real gain appears when a whole function is rebuilt so AI does the first pass across the
chain. Then volume, quality, labor cost, or reinvested capacity can move at the company
level.

## 2. The department is the operating assembly over the ontology

A department is not a new low-level primitive like `skill` or `workflow`. It is an
operating assembly over the existing ontology:

- intake surfaces
- knowledge namespaces
- skills
- agents
- workflows
- tools
- metrics
- projects
- human review gates

The department should also make materially related repos explicit when the work spans more than
one repo. Repos are not a department primitive, but they are often a real operating boundary.

The department makes those pieces legible as one business function.

## 3. Intake must hit AI first

If work enters human inboxes and human heads before it enters the architecture, the system is
still human-first. A true AI department begins with intake. Communication, tickets, ideas,
research, meetings, external signals, and internal requests must flow through intake so AI
can triage, route, and act before a human becomes the bottleneck.

## 4. Each department should have a head-of-department agent

One head-of-department agent should own the department's first pass, routing, escalations,
and daily update. It may delegate heavily to specialist agents and workflows, but it owns
coherence. This gives each department an explicit orchestration surface rather than an
unowned pile of components.

## 5. Humans stay on top as a thin layer

The point is not "no humans." The point is that humans move upward in the stack. They own:

- goals and constraints
- high-stakes approvals
- exception handling
- political and organizational judgment
- deep work the current department cannot absorb

The first pass, however, belongs to the AI department.

## 6. Departments should produce daily updates and roll up

Each department should produce its own daily update, because a department that cannot explain
what it saw, did, escalated, and learned is not really operable. Those department updates
should then roll up into a wider daily brief. This makes the architecture visible at the
operating level, not only in file trees.

## 7. Shared platform capabilities should usually be their own department

Not every department should invent its own GitHub, CI/CD, deployment, secret-management, and
observability stack. Those are usually cross-cutting platform functions and should live in a
shared platform department. Domain departments can then own their local adaptations and
domain-specific workflows on top of that substrate.

## 8. Every real department should have a charter

A department should not only be an assembly map. It should also carry a charter: mission,
north star, owned outcomes, KPI set, constraints, related entities, and reporting cadence.

The index tells you what the department is made of. The charter tells you what the
department is trying to improve and how to judge whether it is working.

## 9. Cross-repo ownership should be explicit

As the OS expands, many departments will depend on repos outside
`infinite-brain-os`. Those repos should be tracked in a root repo registry and linked
from the department index. That keeps repo ownership, digestion posture, and migration inputs
visible instead of buried in chat history.

## Changelog

- 2026-05-31: initial canon for the AI shadow department model and the computer-in-the-corner thesis.
- 2026-05-31: added explicit repo-registry posture for cross-repo department ownership.
